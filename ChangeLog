	* Do not delete the GtkTextTag from the tag table (needed for shared

	* New po/ChangeLog to track translation additions/updates.

version 2.0.5 (26-Jan-2004):
	* Don't check numeric words.  Combined with word breaking changes 
	  recently committed to Pango, this will handle all letter-number
	  combinations nicely.
	* "Add to Dictionary" now actually adds to personal dictionary.
	* New "Ignore All" menuitem to add a word to the current session.

	  autoconf/automake/libtool.
	* Change behavior on a right click so that cutting/copying with

	  work like other apps and delay checking the current word until 
	  the cursor exits it.

	  From Alex <hansolo@rochester.rr.com>.
	* configure.ac: Generate gtkspell.spec from gtkspell.spec.in.
	* README: Add Ari and Alex to a "Thanks" section.
	* configure.ac: Check for libpspell earlier and die if we don't
	  find it.  Prerequire autoconf 2.52.  
	* gtkspell/Makefile.am, examples/Makefile.am: Set CFLAGS instead
	  of foo_CFLAGS (why does the old way not work anymore?).
	* autogen.sh: Don't automatically run configure.
